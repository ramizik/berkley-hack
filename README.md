# Vocal Coach AI - Hackathon Project

Vocal Coach AI is a full-stack web application built for a hackathon. It serves as a personal singing coach that provides users with real-time pitch analysis, deep vocal analytics, and an intelligent, dual-AI coaching system.

The core of the project is a two-pronged AI approach:
1.  **A Proactive Fetch.ai Agent**: Autonomously analyzes daily vocal practice sessions to identify trends and generate progress reports.
2.  **A Reactive Letta Conversational Agent**: Engages in a stateful dialogue with the user, using the data from the Fetch.ai reports to provide personalized, context-aware coaching.

## ðŸš€ Core Features

-   **Real-Time Pitch Detection**: Instant feedback during practice sessions.
-   **Deep Vocal Analysis**: Backend processing provides metrics on jitter, shimmer, vibrato, and more.
